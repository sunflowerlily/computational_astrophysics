* For the Airy disk / Rayleigh criterion, find the zeros of the
  J_1 Bessel function to get the 1.22 factor.

* Integrate a resonance in a planetary system and look at the
  change in eccentricity

* Integrate a multiplanet solar system and give the radial velocity
  vs. time and then use FFT to see if we can get back the number of
  planets and their periods

* Do simple ideal gas + radiation EOS and come in with p, s and
  find the rho, T that satisfy it.
